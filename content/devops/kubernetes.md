Kubernetes, often abbreviated as **K8s**, is a popular *open-source* *container orchestration* platform that automates the *deployment*, *scaling*, and *management* of *containerized applications*. Originally *developed by Google*, it has gained widespread adoption due to its ability to simplify the complexities of containerized environments. At its core, Kubernetes provides a framework for *automating* the *deployment and scaling* of application containers across *clusters of hosts*. It abstracts away the underlying infrastructure, allowing developers to focus on building and deploying applications without worrying about the intricacies of the infrastructure.

Kubernetes operates based on a master-node architecture, where the *master node*, which is now termed as the *control plane* manages the overall cluster and coordinates communication with worker nodes. *Worker nodes*, on the other hand, host the containers (in units called pods) and execute the tasks assigned by the master. Kubernetes supports features like automatic load balancing, rolling updates, and self-healing, making it a powerful tool for managing containerized workloads at scale.

> [!INFO]- No more MASTERS - Moving towards a more inclusive language
> The industry-wide movement toward inclusive language responds to the recognition that certain terms in technology may carry implicit biases. A notable aspect is the shift away from terms like "master" and "slave" to more neutral alternatives, promoting a more welcoming and inclusive environment. This effort, embraced by many organizations and communities, aims to eliminate language that could be exclusionary and contributes to building a diverse and respectful culture within the tech

## Getting to know Kubernetes

### History and Current State of Kubernetes

Kubernetes originated from Google's internal container orchestration system, **Borg**. Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014, allowing it to quickly gain traction as a leading container orchestration platform. The [Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io) took over its governance in 2015, fostering a vibrant and collaborative ecosystem around the project.

Over the years, Kubernetes has evolved to become the de facto standard for container orchestration in the industry. Its robust features for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications have made it a cornerstone of modern cloud-native infrastructure. The project has seen regular updates and enhancements, with a strong focus on scalability, stability, and extensibility. Kubernetes has also spurred the development of a rich ecosystem of tools and services, contributing to its widespread adoption across various industries.

In the current state, Kubernetes continues to be a dynamic and influential force in the world of container orchestration. Its community-driven development model ensures ongoing innovation, and its compatibility with diverse environments, including on-premises data centers and multiple cloud providers, solidifies its role as a key enabler of scalable and resilient application architectures. As Kubernetes matures, it remains a critical technology for organizations seeking to deploy and manage containerized workloads at scale.

### Alternatives to K8s

1. **Docker Swarm** - Docker's native orchestration tool, Swarm, provides a simple and lightweight way to orchestrate Docker containers without the need for Kubernetes.
2. **Nomad** - Developed by HashiCorp, Nomad is a standalone orchestrator that supports both containers and virtual machines. It is designed for simplicity and flexibility.
3. **Mesos/Marathon** - Apache Mesos, combined with the Marathon framework, offers a general-purpose orchestration solution for both containers and traditional workloads.
4. **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)** - ECS is Amazon's proprietary container orchestration service that manages Docker containers. While AWS offers Amazon EKS with Kubernetes, ECS itself is a separate solution.

### Why Kubernetes?

Kubernetes has emerged as the de facto standard for container orchestration due to its comprehensive feature set, robust architecture, and widespread community adoption. The advantages of using Kubernetes extend across various aspects of containerized application management:

1. **Automated Deployment and Scaling**
	- Kubernetes allows users to define the desired state of their applications, and it automatically handles the deployment and scaling of containerized workloads to meet that desired state.
	- Automated scaling features, including horizontal pod autoscaling, enable applications to dynamically scale based on demand.
2. **High Availability and Fault Tolerance**
	- Kubernetes ensures high availability by distributing applications across multiple nodes in a cluster.
	- It automatically reschedules and replaces failed containers, contributing to fault tolerance.
	- Self-healing mechanisms detect and address issues, minimizing downtime and disruptions to applications.
3. **Service Discovery and Load Balancing**
	- Kubernetes provides built-in service discovery, allowing containers within a cluster to find and communicate with each other using DNS or environment variables.
	- Integrated load balancing ensures even distribution of traffic among containerized applications, optimizing performance and reliability.
4. **Resource Efficiency**
	- Kubernetes efficiently utilizes resources by packing containers onto nodes based on resource requirements and constraints. This ensures optimal use of computing resources in the cluster.
	- Resource quotas and limits allow for fine-grained control over resource allocation, preventing one application from monopolizing resources.
5. **Declarative Configuration**
	- Users can define the desired state of their applications and infrastructure using declarative configuration files (YAML). This approach simplifies deployment and promotes version control of configurations.
	- Declarative syntax allows for easy tracking of changes, collaboration, and rollbacks to previous configurations.
6. **Extensive Ecosystem**
	- Kubernetes has a rich ecosystem of extensions, tools, and plugins. This includes Helm charts for package management, Operators for automating application management, and a variety of storage and networking solutions.
	- The vast ecosystem contributes to Kubernetes' adaptability to diverse use cases and environments.
7. **Portability and Vendor Neutrality**
	- Kubernetes is open source and follows a container-centric infrastructure approach, making it vendor-agnostic. It can run on various cloud providers, on-premises data centers, and even edge environments.
	- This portability ensures that applications built and deployed on Kubernetes can easily move across different environments without major modifications.
8. **Community Support and Innovation**
	- Kubernetes benefits from a large and active open-source community. This community-driven development model fosters innovation, continuous improvement, and the rapid adoption of emerging best practices.
	- Regular releases and updates introduce new features, security enhancements, and performance improvements.
9. **Built-in Security Features**
	- Kubernetes provides several security features, including role-based access control (RBAC), pod security policies, and network policies. These features help enforce access controls and secure communication between pods.
	- Kubernetes allows for integration with container runtime security solutions and provides a foundation for building secure containerized applications.
10. **Standardization and Industry Support**
	- Kubernetes has become a standard for container orchestration, with major cloud providers offering managed Kubernetes services (Amazon EKS, Google Kubernetes Engine, Azure Kubernetes Service).
	- Standardization simplifies the deployment and management of containerized applications, fostering a consistent experience across different environments.
