Hey there, this is the collection of personal notes of one Patrick Ambrose. This is always going to be a work in progress and things might not be polished. But feel free to explore and hopefully you get some value out of it. For my day job, I work as a systems administrator and a digitization specialist and soon hoping to get into DevOps, Cloud and Data. But this collection of notes could contain anything from Cuneiforms to Cloud Technology, and it is a dump of things that I come across and explore, and not a representation of my views or ideologies.

## My Approach to PKM
**PKM** or **Personal Knowledge Management** is a process of collecting and processing the information that an individual comes across in their lifetime. This collection of information shall then guide the individual in accessing the information later when required.

I believe that consuming a piece of information that does not add value in either *intellectual*, *emotional*, *spiritual*, *financial* or *physical* avenues (*in no particular order*) is a waste of time and life. When consuming such content selectively, I believe that capturing it, nurturing it and getting use out of it would be immensely beneficial to the tomorrow me. 

So here are my notes, of almost (*except the personal stuff I would not want on the internet*) everything that I consume on a regular basis.

## So, where do I start?
I made this DOCUSITE with [serendipity](serendipity.md) in mind. So, not all pages would be linked explicitly in the navigation pane. 

## FAQs 
1. **How do you organize the notes?**
	My preference in organization is to be rigid enough for easy pinpoint navigation, but open enough to encourage serendipitous discovery. So how do I achieve these polar opposites in this notes collection? 
	- The rigidity in structure is built upon nested directories (*I know they stretch across multiple levels, but like I said it is a work in progress and things could change*). This enables to easily navigate to a file even without an application to help me make sense of the gobbledygook of the multitude of notes. thereby promoting perpetuity by making sure that even without an application like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (*which is what I use to take and make notes*), I can find the notes notes with a little bit of clinking through the different folder structure.
	- To encourage serendipitous discovery, applications like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) or [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) or [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) support backlinks and unlinked mentions, which are two of the most powerful features of any tool for networked thought. Plus having a way to visually connect notes via a graphing feature is a plus too.
2. **Do you use any PKM paradigm?**
	Yes, my organization structure is based loosely on the famous MOC structure popularized byÂ [Nick Milo](https://twitter.com/nickmilo)Â with hisÂ [Linking Your Thinking](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/)Â approach. But I took the liberty to allow my system to organically grow and evolve as I take more notes and understand new things. That being said, I have sat down and radically changed my organization structure countless times, therefore the paradigm might have changed the next time you visit this notes collection.
3. **What is your view on Links vs Tags?**
	I use tags to aid in loose interconnection and links to assist in intentional linking. If you do not see the tags, it is likely hidden in the metadata section. If you do see tags, either something is broke and I would eventually fix it or I might be trying out some new stuff.
